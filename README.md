My goal upon receiving this assignment was to clean up the code in the .html and .css files, while still maintaining the integrity of the website.

I achieved this goal in the .html by changing the div elements into semantic elements to help other developers see more clearly what the code was trying to convey.  By doing this I was able to remove a lot of unnecessary classes as well.

In the .css, I was able to rename the properties based on the new element classes given in the .html file, rather than through classes. I was also able to condense repeated style values into single groupings.
